Heeeey Hello!! ðŸ¥°ðŸ¥° 
It's me again!! 
Well, It's been a while! Guess who decided to show up!

<br>Honestly the past two weeks have been a bit of a rollercoaster. I couldn't find my writer's chi for a while ðŸ¥ºðŸ¥ºðŸ¥º. My previous drafts all felt like a string of junk pieced together and ðŸ’©ðŸ’©ðŸ’©. </br>Ever felt like smashing your laptop and phone and just Smash Smash Smash everything, then your account is like, 'Yeees smash everything! Because you got a million dollars in the bank right?'
<br>Damn adulting sucks.</br> 
<br> You know its bad when you fully relate to Squidward. </br>

<br>ANYWHOO, Back to business. How AWS Will Benefit Your Business.</br>
<br>So first of all, why AWS? As a business owner, migrating to the cloud and choosing a cloud provider can be daunting. </br>

- How secure is it to fully migrate to the cloud?
- Which cloud provider to choose?
- How affordable will it be?
- Will migrating disrupt my business?
- Will I have to hire a cloud specialist to manage everything?
- Do I really need this cloud thingy anyways?

So many concerns! But not to worry though, here's why AWS is the best choice for your business.

*Image from [Gartner](https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2021-06-28-gartner-says-worldwide-iaas-public-cloud-services-market-grew-40-7-percent-in-2020)*

<br>[Gartner](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/IT), an industry research and consulting company, reported that, with a [41% market share](https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2021-06-28-gartner-says-worldwide-iaas-public-cloud-services-market-grew-40-7-percent-in-2020) and a revenue of $26.2 billion as of 2020, AWS clearly dominates the public cloud services market. </br>

<br>Not only that, but Gartner also recognized AWS as the [2021 Magic Quadrant Leader](https://aws.amazon.com/resources/analyst-reports/gartner-mq-cips-2021/). This award shows that out of all the public cloud services providers, AWS is quoted as *a Leader placed highest in both axes of measurement, Ability to Execute and Completeness of Vision.* (Gartner report, 2021). </br>

<br>Currently, the number of active AWS users is [over 1,000,000](https://www.contino.io/insights/whos-using-aws). And a majority of the user base are small to middle- level businesses, with large enterprises such as Netflix, LinkedIn, Facebook making up 10% of its user base.</br>
 So clearly, you are in very good hands!

<br>Some of the reasons why AWS has such a large fan base is because;
- You only pay for what you use
- It has solid security features. Your systems and data are highly secure.
- It has a comprehensive disaster recovery system
- It is easy to set up and maintain 
- It's very flexible. A startup's best friend.
<br>You can find other reasons to choose AWS as your cloud service provider [here.](https://dzone.com/articles/7-reasons-to-choose-aws-as-your-cloud-platform#:~:text=One%20of%20the%20top%20AWS,cloud%20computing%20affordable%20for%20you.)</br>

Here's another [article](https://www.clickittech.com/aws/why-aws-cloud/amp/) which I found to be worthwhile. 

It won't hurt to also go through the [AWS Documentation](https://aws.amazon.com/application-hosting/benefits/)



<br>Fun fact!! A whooping 92% of all the live websites on the internet today are hosted on AWS. </br>

*Image from [siteefy](https://siteefy.com/how-many-websites-are-there/#:~:text=Currently%2C%20there%20are%20around%201.18%20billion%20websites%20in%20the%20World.)*

<br>So, as you can see, out of 200 million current live websites, 92 % of them are hosted on AWS. That makes around 184 millionðŸ¤­. </br>
<br>Now with all of this hard evidence around, if you are still doubtful of AWS, then congrats!! You have given doubting Thomas a run for his money! ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ You really deserve this oscars- worthy appreciation! ðŸ™ƒ

<br>Now this short and sweet article was an introduction to why choose AWS for your business. Hopefully it was informative! And slaps so hard! ðŸ¤­</br>
<br>On my next post, we will now delve deeper into AWS services, category by category, and how they are useful to your business. AWS offers over 200 services, so it can be quite overwhelming for a newbie to navigate the different services and figure out which one to use.</br>


![image007.jpg](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1649089253206/PyRg4IaAz.jpg)

So AWS services are divided into five main categories;
1. Compute
2. Storage
3. Database
4. Networking and Content Delivery
5. Security, Identity and Compliance.

<br>On my next series of posts, we will go through each category step by step, delve into the services in each category and design realtime scenarios and how AWS provides solutions to common challenges businesses face. </br>
<br>Most of these services integrate with each other, so as we go through the services and design the use cases, we'll use some services recurrently! I really can't waitðŸ¤—ðŸ¤—ðŸ¤—. Hasta la vista baby!! </br>
